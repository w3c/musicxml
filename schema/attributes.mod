<!--
	The time-separator entity indicates how to display the
	arrangement between the beats and beat-type values in a
	time signature. The default value is none. The horizontal,
	diagonal, and vertical values represent horizontal, diagonal
	lower-left to upper-right, and vertical lines respectively. 
	For these values, the beats and beat-type values are arranged
	on either side of the separator line. The none value represents
	no separator with the beats and beat-type arranged vertically.
	The adjacent value represents no separator with the beats and
	beat-type arranged horizontally.

<!--
	The time-symbol entity indicates how to display a time
	signature. The normal value is the usual fractional display,
	and is the implied symbol type if none is specified. Other
	options are the common and cut time symbols, as well as a
	single number with an implied denominator. The note symbol
	indicates that the beat-type should be represented with
	the corresponding downstem note rather than a number. The
	dotted-note symbol indicates that the beat-type should be
	represented with a dotted downstem note that corresponds to
	three times the beat-type value, and a numerator that is
	one third the beats value.

<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	The attributes element contains musical information that
	typically changes on measure boundaries. This includes
	key and time signatures, clefs, transpositions, and staving.
	When attributes are changed mid-measure, it affects the
	music in score order, not in MusicXML document order.
-->
<!ELEMENT attributes (%editorial;, divisions?, key*, time*,
	staves?, part-symbol?, instruments?, clef*, staff-details*,
	(transpose* | for-part*), directive*, measure-style*)>

<!--	
	Traditional key signatures are represented by the number
	of flats and sharps, plus an optional mode for major/
	minor/mode distinctions. Negative numbers are used for
	flats and positive numbers for sharps, reflecting the
	key's placement within the circle of fifths (hence the
	element name). A cancel element indicates that the old
	key signature should be cancelled before the new one
	appears. This will always happen when changing to C major
	or A minor and need not be specified then. The cancel
	value matches the fifths value of the cancelled key
	signature (e.g., a cancel of -2 will provide an explicit
	cancellation for changing from B flat major to F major).
	The optional location attribute indicates where a key
	signature cancellation appears relative to a new key
	signature: to the left, to the right, or before the barline
	and to the left. It is left by default. For mid-measure key
	elements, a cancel location of before-barline should be
	treated like a cancel location of left.
	
	Non-traditional key signatures are represented using a list
	of altered tones. The key-step and key-alter elements are
	represented the same way as the step and alter elements are
	in the pitch element in the note.mod file. The optional
	key-accidental element is represented the same way as the
	accidental element in the note.mod file. It is used for
	disambiguating microtonal accidentals. The different element
	names indicate the different meaning of altering notes in a
	scale versus altering a sounding pitch.
	
	Valid mode values include major, minor, dorian, phrygian,
	lydian, mixolydian, aeolian, ionian, locrian, and none.

	The optional number attribute refers to staff numbers, 
	from top to bottom on the system. If absent, the key
	signature applies to all staves in the part.

	The optional list of key-octave elements is used to specify
	in which octave each element of the key signature appears.
	The content specifies the octave value using the same
	values as the display-octave element. The number attribute
	is a positive integer that refers to the key signature
	element in left-to-right order. If the cancel attribute is
	set to yes, then this number refers to the canceling key
	signature specified by the cancel element in the parent key
	element. The cancel attribute cannot be set to yes if there is
	no corresponding cancel element within the parent key element.
	It is no by default.

	Key signatures appear at the start of each system unless
	the print-object attribute has been set to "no".

	Musical notation duration is commonly represented as
	fractions. The divisions element indicates how many 
	divisions per quarter note are used to indicate a note's
	duration. For example, if duration = 1 and divisions = 2,
	this is an eighth note duration. Duration and divisions
	are used directly for generating sound output, so they
	must be chosen to take tuplets into account. Using a
	divisions element lets us use just one number to 
	represent a duration for each note in the score, while
	retaining the full power of a fractional representation.
	For maximum compatibility with Standard MIDI Files, the
	divisions value should not exceed 16383.
-->
<!ELEMENT divisions (#PCDATA)>

<!--
	Time signatures are represented by two elements. The
	beats element indicates the number of beats, as found in
	the numerator of a time signature. The beat-type element
	indicates the beat unit, as found in the denominator of
	a time signature.

	Multiple pairs of beats and beat-type elements are used for
	composite time signatures with multiple denominators, such
	as 2/4 + 3/8. A composite such as 3+2/8 requires only one
	beats/beat-type pair. 

	The interchangeable element is used to represent the second
	in a pair of interchangeable dual time signatures, such as
	the 6/8 in 3/4 (6/8). A separate symbol attribute value is
	available compared to the time element's symbol attribute,
	which applies to the first of the dual time signatures.
	The time-relation element indicates the symbol used to
	represent the interchangeable aspect of the time signature.
	Valid values are parentheses, bracket, equals, slash, space,
	and hyphen.

	A senza-misura element explicitly indicates that no time
	signature is present. The optional element content
	indicates the symbol to be used, if any, such as an X.
	The time element's symbol attribute is not used when a
	senza-misura element is present.

	The print-object attribute allows a time signature to be
	specified but not printed, as is the case for excerpts
	from the middle of a score. The value is "yes" if
	not present. The optional number attribute refers to staff
	numbers within the part, from top to bottom on the system. 
	If absent, the time signature applies to all staves in the 
	part.

	Staves are used if there is more than one staff
	represented in the given part (e.g., 2 staves for
	typical piano parts). If absent, a value of 1 is assumed.

	none, brace, line, bracket, and square; brace is the default.
	The top-staff and bottom-staff attributes are used when the
	brace does not extend across the entire part. For example, in
	a 3-staff organ part, the top-staff will typically be 1 for
	the right hand, while the bottom-staff will typically be 2
	for the left hand. Staff 3 for the pedals is usually outside
	the brace. By default, the presence of a part-symbol element
	that does not extend across the entire part also indicates a 
	corresponding change in the common barlines within a part.

<!--
	Clefs are represented by the sign, line, and
	clef-octave-change elements. Sign values include G,
	F, C, percussion, TAB, jianpu, and none. 
	
	The jianpu sign indicates that the music that follows
	should be in jianpu numbered notation, just as the TAB
	sign indicates that the music that follows should be in
	tablature notation. Unlike TAB, a jianpu sign does not
	correspond to a visual clef notation.
	
	The none sign is deprecated as of MusicXML 4.0. Use the clef
	element's print-object attribute instead. When the none sign
	is used, notes should be displayed as if in treble clef.

	Line numbers are counted from the bottom of the staff.
	They are only needed with the G, F, and C signs in order
	to position a pitch correctly on the staff. Standard
	values are 2 for the G sign (treble clef), 4 for the F
	sign (bass clef), and 3 for the C sign (alto clef). Line
	values can be used to specify positions outside the staff,
	such as a C clef positioned in the middle of a grand staff.
	
	The clef-octave-change element is used for transposing
	clefs. A treble clef for tenors would have a value of -1.
	
	The optional number attribute refers to staff numbers
	within the part, from top to bottom on the system. A
	value of 1 is assumed if not present. 

	Sometimes clefs are added to the staff in non-standard
	line positions, either to indicate cue passages, or when
	there are multiple clefs present simultaneously on one
	staff. In this situation, the additional attribute is set to
	"yes" and the line value is ignored. The size attribute
	is used for clefs where the additional attribute is "yes".
	It is typically used to indicate cue clefs.

	Sometimes clefs at the start of a measure need to appear
	after the barline rather than before, as for cues or for
	use after a repeated section. The after-barline attribute
	is set to "yes" in this situation. The attribute is ignored
	for mid-measure clefs.

	Clefs appear at the start of each system unless the 
	print-object attribute has been set to "no" or the 
	additional attribute has been set to "yes".

<!--
	The staff-details element is used to indicate different
	types of staves. 
	
	The staff-type element can be ossia, editorial, cue,
	alternate, or regular. An ossia staff represents music
	that can be played instead of what appears on the regular
	staff. An editorial staff also represents musical 
	alternatives, but is created by an editor rather than the
	composer. It can be used for suggested interpretations or
	alternatives from other sources. A cue staff represents
	music from another part. An alternate staff shares the
	same music as the prior staff, but displayed differently
	(e.g., treble and bass clef, standard notation and
	tablature). It is not included in playback. An alternate
	staff provides more information to an application reading a
	file than encoding the same music in separate parts, so its
	use is preferred in this situation if feasible. A regular
	staff is the standard default staff-type.
	
	The staff-lines element specifies the number of lines and
	is usually used for a non 5-line staff. If the staff-lines
	element is present, the appearance of each line may be
	individually specified with a line-detail element. Staff
	lines are numbered from bottom to top. The print-object
	attribute allows lines to be hidden within a staff. This
	is used in special situations such as a widely-spaced
	percussion staff where a note placed below the higher line
	is distinct from a note placed above the lower line. Hidden
	staff lines are included when specifying clef lines and
	determining display-step / display-octave values, but are
	not counted as lines for the purposes of the system-layout
	and staff-layout elements.
	
	The staff-tuning and capo elements are used to specify tuning
	when using tablature notation.
	
	The optional number attribute specifies the staff number from
	top to bottom on the system, as with clef. The optional
	show-frets attribute indicates whether to show tablature
	frets as numbers (0, 1, 2) or letters (a, b, c). The default
	choice is numbers. The print-object attribute is used to
	indicate when a staff is not printed in a part, usually in
	large scores where empty parts are omitted. It is yes by 
	default. If print-spacing is yes while print-object is no,
	the score is printed in cutaway format where vertical space
	is left for the empty part.

<!--
	The staff-size element indicates how large a staff space
	is on this staff, expressed as a percentage of the work's
	default scaling. Values less than 100 make the staff space
	smaller while values over 100 make the staff space larger.
	A staff-type of cue, ossia, or editorial implies a
	staff-size of less than 100, but the exact value is
	implementation-dependent unless specified here. Staff size
	affects staff height only, not the relationship of the staff
	to the left and right margins.
	
	In some cases, a staff-size different than 100 also scales
	the notation on the staff, such as with a cue staff. In
	other cases, such as percussion staves, the lines may be
	more widely spaced without scaling the notation on the
	staff. The scaling attribute allows these two cases to be
	distinguished. It specifies the percentage scaling that 
	applies to the notation. Values less that 100 make the
	notation smaller while values over 100 make the notation
	larger. The staff-size content and scaling attribute are
	both non-negative decimal values.

<!--
	If the part is being encoded for a transposing instrument
	in written vs. concert pitch, the transposition must be
	encoded in the transpose element. The transpose element
	represents what must be added to the written pitch to get
	the correct sounding pitch.

	The transposition is represented by chromatic steps
	(required) and three optional elements: diatonic pitch
	steps, octave changes, and doubling an octave down. 
	
	The chromatic element represents the number of semitones
	needed to get from written to sounding pitch. The diatonic
	element specifies the number of pitch steps needed to go
	from written to sounding pitch. This allows for correct
	spelling of enharmonic transpositions. The octave-change
	element indicates how many octaves to add to get from
	written pitch to sounding pitch. Neither the chromatic nor
	the diatonic element include octave-change values; the
	values for both elements need to be added to the written
	pitch to get the correct sounding pitch. The octave-change
	element should be included when using transposition
	intervals of an octave or more, and should not be present
	for intervals of less than an octave. 
	
	If the double element is present, it indicates that the
	music is doubled one octave from what is currently written.
	If the above attribute is set to yes, the doubling is one
	octave above what is written, as for mixed flute / piccolo
	parts in band literature. Otherwise the doubling is one
	octave below what is written, as for mixed cello / bass
	parts in orchestral literature.
	
	The optional number attribute refers to staff numbers, 
	from top to bottom on the system. If absent, the
	transposition applies to all staves in the part. Per-staff 
	transposition is most often used in parts that represent
	multiple instruments.

	The for-part element is used in a concert score to indicate

	scores with transposed parts to be represented in a single
