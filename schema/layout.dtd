<!--
	MusicXML 1.1 adds layout information for pages,
	systems, staffs, and measures. These layout elements 
	join the print and sound elements in providing 
	formatting data as elements rather than attributes.

	Everything is measured in tenths of staff space.
	Tenths are then scaled to millimeters within the
	scaling element, used in the defaults element at
	the start of a score. Individual staves can apply
	a scaling factor to adjust staff size. When a
	MusicXML element or attribute refers to tenths,
	it means the global tenths defined by the scaling
	element, not the local tenths as adjusted by the
	staff-size element.
-->

<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	Margins, page sizes, and distances are all measured in
	tenths to keep MusicXML data in a consistent coordinate
	system as much as possible. The translation to absolute
	units is done in the scaling element, which specifies
	how many millimeters are equal to how many tenths. For
	a staff height of 7 mm, millimeters would be set to 7
	while tenths is set to 40. The ability to set a formula
	rather than a single scaling factor helps avoid roundoff
	errors.

	System layout includes left and right margins and the

	The system distance is measured from the bottom line
	of the previous system to the top line of the current
	system. It is ignored for the first system on a page.
	The top system distance is measured from the page's
	top margin to the top line of the first system. It is
