	The part-list identifies the different musical parts in
	this movement. Each part has an ID that is used later
	within the musical data. Since parts may be encoded
	separately and combined later, identification elements
	are present at both the score and score-part levels.
	There must be at least one score-part, combined as
	desired with part-group elements that indicate braces
	and brackets. Parts are ordered from top to bottom in
	a score based on the order in which they appear in the
	part-list.
	
	Each MusicXML part corresponds to a track in a Standard
	MIDI Format 1 file. The score-instrument elements are
	used when there are multiple instruments per track.
	The midi-device element is used to make a MIDI device
	or port assignment for the given track. Initial
	midi-instrument assignments may be made here as well.

	The part-name indicates the full name of the musical

	part-abbreviation will precede the other systems.

	The part-group element indicates groupings of parts in
	the score, usually indicated by braces and brackets.
	The number attribute is used to distinguish overlapping
	and nested part-groups, not the sequence of groups. As
	with parts, groups can have a name and abbreviation.
	The group-symbol element indicates how the group is 
	indicated on the score. Values include none (default),
	brace, line, and bracket. Values for the child elements
	are ignored at the stop of a group. The group-barline
	element indicates if the group should have common
	barlines. Values can be yes, no, or Mensurstrich.

	The score-instrument element allows for multiple
	instruments per score-part. As with the score-part
	element, each score-instrument has a required ID
	attribute, a name, and an optional abbreviation.
	A score-instrument element is also required if the
	score specifies MIDI channels, banks, or programs.
	An initial midi-instrument assignment can also
	be made here. MusicXML software should be able to
	automatically assign reasonable channels and 
	instruments without these elements in simple cases,
	such as where part names match General MIDI
	instrument names.
	
	The midi-instrument element is defined in common.dtd,
	as it can be used within both the score-part and
	sound elements.

	The score is the root element for the DTD. It includes
	the score-header entity, followed either by a series of
	parts with measures inside (score-partwise) or a series
	of measures with parts inside (score-timewise). Having
	distinct top-level elements for partwise and timewise
	scores makes it easy to ensure that an XSLT stylesheet
	does not try to transform a document already in the
	desired format.

	The version attribute is new to MusicXML 1.1. It provides
	an easier way to get version information than through the
	MusicXML public ID. The default value is 1.0 to make it 
	possible for programs that handle version 1.1 to 
	distinguish version 1.0 files reliably. Programs that
	write MusicXML 1.1 files should set this attribute.
