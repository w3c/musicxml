	V of II). A sequence of harmony-chord entities is used

	A root is a pitch name like C, D, E, where a function is
	an indication like I, II, III. Root is generally used
	with pop chord symbols, function with classical
	functional harmony. It is an either/or choice to avoid
	data inconsistency. Function requires that the key be
	specified in the encoding. The root element has a
	root-step and optional root-alter similar to the step

	Kind indicates the type of chord. Degree elements

	Triads:
	    major (major third, perfect fifth)
	    minor (minor third, perfect fifth)
	    augmented (major third, augmented fifth)
	    diminished (minor third, diminished fifth)

	    dominant-ninth (dominant-seventh, major ninth)
	    major-ninth (major-seventh, major ninth)
	    minor-ninth (minor-seventh, minor ninth)
	11ths (usually as the basis for alteration):

	    major-11th (major-ninth, perfect 11th)
	    minor-11th (minor-ninth, perfect 11th)
	13ths (usually as the basis for alteration):

	    major-13th (major-11th, major 13th)
	    minor-13th (minor-11th, major 13th)
	Suspended:
	    suspended-second (major second, perfect fifth)
	    suspended-fourth (perfect fourth, perfect fifth)
	Functional sixths:
	    Neapolitan
	    Italian
	    French
	    German
	Other:
	    pedal (pedal-point bass)
	    Tristan
	
	The "other" kind is used when the harmony is entirely
	composed of add elements. The "none" kind is used to
	explicitly encode absence of chords or functional
	harmony.

	The attributes are used to indicate the formatting
	of the symbol. Since the kind element is the constant
	in all the harmony-chord entities that can make up
	a polychord, many formatting attributes are here.

	The use-symbols attribute is yes if the kind should be
	represented when possible with harmony symbols rather
	than letters and numbers. These symbols include:

	    major: a triangle, like Unicode 25B3
	    minor: -, like Unicode 002D
	    augmented: +, like Unicode 002B
	    diminished: °, like Unicode 00B0
	    half-diminished: ø, like Unicode 00F8

	The text attribute describes how the kind should be 
	spelled if not using symbols; it is ignored if use-symbols
	is yes. The stack-degrees attribute is yes if the degree 
	elements should be stacked above each other. The 
	parentheses-degrees attribute is yes if all the degrees 
	should be in parentheses. The bracket-degrees attribute
	is yes if all the degrees should be in a bracket. If not 
	specified, these values are implementation-specific.

	Bass is used to indicate a bass note in popular music
	chord symbols, e.g. G/C. It is generally not used in

	The degree element is used to add, alter, or subtract
	individual notes in the chord. The degree-value element
	is a number indicating the degree of the chord (1 for
	the root, 3 for third, etc). The degree-alter element
	is like the alter element in notes: 1 for sharp, -1 for
	flat, etc. The degree-type element can be add, alter, or
	subtract. If the degree-type is alter or subtract, the
	degree-alter is relative to the degree already in the
	chord based on its kind element. If the degree-type is
	add, the degree-alter is relative to a dominant chord
	(major and perfect intervals except for a minor 
	seventh). The print-object attribute can be used to
	keep the degree from printing separately when it has
	already taken into account in the text attribute of
	the kind element.

	music onto the same system or page as the preceding

	measure. If used in multi-part music, they should be

	The sound element contains general playback parameters.
	They can stand alone within a part/measure, or be a
	component element within a direction.
	
	Tempo is expressed in quarter notes per minute. If 0,
	the sound-generating program must prompt the user at the
	time of compiling a sound (MIDI) file.
	
	Dynamics (or MIDI velocity) are expressed as a percentage
	of the default forte value (90 for MIDI).
	
	Dacapo indicates to go back to the beginning of the
	movement. When used it always has the value "yes".
	
	Segno and dalsegno are used for backwards jumps to a
	segno sign; coda and tocoda are used for forward jumps
	to a coda sign. If there are multiple jumps, the value
	of these parameters can be used to name and distinguish
	them. If segno or coda is used, the divisions attribute
	can also be used to indicate the number of divisions
	per quarter note. Otherwise sound and MIDI generating
	programs may have to recompute this.
	
	A dalsegno or dacapo attribute indicates that the
	jump should occur the first time through; a tocoda
	attribute indicates the jump should occur the second
	time through.
	
	Forward-repeat is used when a forward repeat sign is
	implied, and usually follows a bar line. When used it
	always has the value of "yes".
	
	The fine attribute follows the final note or rest in a
	movement with a da capo direction. If numeric, the value
	represents the actual duration of the final note or rest,
	which can be ambiguous in written notation and different
	among parts and voices. The value may also be "yes" to
	indicate no change to the final duration.
	
	If the sound element applies only one time through a
	repeat, the time-only attribute indicates which time
	to apply the sound element.
	
	Pizzicato in a sound element effects all following notes.
	Yes indicates pizzicato, no indicates arco.
	
	Pan and elevation allow placing of sound in a 3-D space
	relative to the listener. Both are expressed in degrees
	ranging from -180 to 180. For pan, 0 is straight ahead,
	-90 is hard left, 90 is hard right, and -180 and 180
	are directly behind the listener. For elevation, 0 is
	level with the listener, 90 is directly above, and -90
	is directly below.
	
	The damper-pedal, soft-pedal, and sostenuto-pedal 
	attributes effect playback of the three common piano
	pedals and their MIDI controller equivalents. Yes
	indicates the pedal is depressed; no indicates the 
	pedal is released.
	
	MIDI instruments are changed using the midi-instrument
	element defined in common.dtd.
