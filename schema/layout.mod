<!--
	Version 1.1 of the MusicXML format added layout information
	for pages, systems, staffs, and measures. These layout
	elements joined the print and sound elements in providing
	formatting data as elements rather than attributes.

	Everything is measured in tenths of staff space. Tenths are
	then scaled to millimeters within the scaling element, used
	in the defaults element at the start of a score. Individual
	staves can apply a scaling factor to adjust staff size.
	When a MusicXML element or attribute refers to tenths,
	it means the global tenths defined by the scaling element,
	not the local tenths as adjusted by the staff-size element.
-->

<!-- Entities -->

<!--
	The common-layout entity specifies the sequence of page,
	system, and staff layout elements that is common to both
	the defaults and print elements.

<!--
	Margins, page sizes, and distances are all measured in
	tenths to keep MusicXML data in a consistent coordinate
	system as much as possible. The translation to absolute
	units is done in the scaling element, which specifies
	how many millimeters are equal to how many tenths. For
	a staff height of 7 mm, millimeters would be set to 7
	while tenths is set to 40. The ability to set a formula
	rather than a single scaling factor helps avoid roundoff
	errors.

	Page layout can be defined both in score-wide defaults
	and in the print element. Page margins are specified either
	for both even and odd pages, or via separate odd and even
	page number values. The type is not needed when used as
	part of a print element. If omitted when used in the
	defaults element, "both" is the default.

	If no page-layout element is present in the defaults
	element, default page layout values are chosen by the

	When used in the print element, the page-layout element
	affects the appearance of the current page only. All
	other pages use the default values as determined by the

	the page-layout element in a print element, the values 
	determined by the defaults element are used there as well.

<!--
	A system is a group of staves that are read and played 
	simultaneously. System layout includes left and right 
	margins, the vertical distance from the previous system,
	and the presence or absence of system dividers. 

	Margins are relative to the page margins. Positive values
	indent and negative values reduce the margin size. The
	system distance is measured from the bottom line of the
	previous system to the top line of the current system.
	It is ignored for the first system on a page. The top
	system distance is measured from the page's top margin to
	the top line of the first system. It is ignored for all
	but the first system on a page.

	Sometimes the sum of measure widths in a system may not
	equal the system width specified by the layout elements due
	to roundoff or other errors. The behavior when reading
	MusicXML files in these cases is application-dependent.
	For instance, applications may find that the system layout
	data is more reliable than the sum of the measure widths,
	and adjust the measure widths accordingly.

	When used in the defaults element, the system-layout element
	defines a default appearance for all systems in the score.
	If no system-layout element is present in the defaults
	element, default system layout values are chosen by the
	application.
	
	When used in the print element, the system-layout element
	affects the appearance of the current system only. All
	other systems use the default values as determined by the
	defaults element. If any child elements are missing from
	the system-layout element in a print element, the values 
	determined by the defaults element are used there as well.
	This type of system-layout element need only be read from 
	or written to the first visible part in the score.

	The system-dividers element indicates the presence or
	absence of system dividers (also known as system separation
	marks) between systems displayed on the same page. Dividers
	on the left and right side of the page are controlled by
	the left-divider and right-divider elements respectively.
	The default vertical position is half the system-distance
	value from the top of the system that is below the divider.
	The default horizontal position is the left and right
	system margin, respectively.

	When used in the print element, the system-dividers element
	affects the dividers that would appear between the current
	system and the previous system.

	Staff layout includes the vertical distance from the bottom

	optional number attribute refers to staff numbers within

	is used if not present. 
	
	When used in the defaults element, the values apply to all
	systems in all parts. When used in the print element, the

	systems with codas. To specify the measure width,
	use the width attribute of the measure element.

<!--
	The appearance element controls general graphical
	settings for the music's final form appearance on a
	printed page of display. This includes support
	for line widths, definitions for note sizes, and standard
	distances between notation elements, plus an extension
	element for other aspects of appearance.

	The line-width element indicates the width of a line type
	in tenths. The type attribute defines what type of line is
	being defined. Values include beam, bracket, dashes,
	enclosure, ending, extend, heavy barline, leger,
	light barline, octave shift, pedal, slur middle, slur tip,
	staff, stem, tie middle, tie tip, tuplet bracket, and
	wedge. The text content is expressed in tenths.

	The note-size element indicates the percentage of the
	regular note size to use for notes with a cue and large
	size as defined in the type element. The grace-cue type
	is used for notes of grace-cue size. The grace type is
	used for notes of cue size that include a grace element.
	The cue type is used for all other notes with cue size,
	whether defined explicitly or implicitly via a cue element.
	The large type is used for notes of large size. The text
	content represent the numeric percentage. A value of 100
	would be identical to the size of a regular note as defined
	by the music font.

	The distance element represents standard distances between
	notation elements in tenths. The type attribute defines what
	type of distance is being defined. Values include hyphen
	(for hyphens in lyrics) and beam.

	The glyph element represents what SMuFL glyph should be used
	for different variations of symbols that are semantically
	identical. The type attribute specifies what type of glyph
	is being defined. The element value specifies what
	SMuFL glyph to use, including recommended stylistic
	alternates.

	Glyph type attribute values include quarter-rest, 
	g-clef-ottava-bassa, c-clef, f-clef, percussion-clef,
	octave-shift-up-8, octave-shift-down-8,
	octave-shift-continue-8, octave-shift-down-15,
	octave-shift-up-15, octave-shift-continue-15,
	octave-shift-down-22, octave-shift-up-22, and 
	octave-shift-continue-22. A quarter-rest type specifies the
	glyph to use when a note has a rest element and a type value
	of quarter. The c-clef, f-clef, and percussion-clef types
	specify the glyph to use when a clef sign element value is C,
	F, or percussion respectively. The g-clef-ottava-bassa type
	specifies the glyph to use when a clef sign element value is
	G and the clef-octave-change element value is -1. The
	octave-shift types specify the glyph to use when an
	octave-shift type attribute value is up, down, or continue
	and the octave-shift size attribute value is 8, 15, or 22.

	The SMuFL glyph name should match the type. For instance,
	a type of quarter-rest would use values restQuarter,
	restQuarterOld, or restQuarterZ. A type of g-clef-ottava-bassa
	would use values gClef8vb, gClef8vbOld, or gClef8vbCClef. A
	type of octave-shift-up-8 would use values ottava, ottavaBassa,
	ottavaBassaBa, ottavaBassaVb, or octaveBassa.

	The other-appearance element is used to define any
	graphical settings not yet in the current version of the
	MusicXML format. This allows extended representation,
	though without application interoperability.
