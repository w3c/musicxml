	The DTD version of the MusicXML format is deprecated
	as of Version 4.0. Use the opus.xsd W3C XML Schema
	definition instead.

<!--
	An opus collects MusicXML scores together into a larger
	entity. The individual scores could be movements in a
	symphony, scenes or acts in an opera, or songs in an
	album. The opus definition allows arbitrary nesting
	either via an opus (included in the document) or an
	opus-link (linked like scores). Future versions of the
	MusicXML format may expand this DTD to include reference
	data and other metadata related to musical scores.
	
	Suggested use:
	
	<!DOCTYPE opus PUBLIC
		"-//Recordare//DTD MusicXML 4.0 Opus//EN"
		"http://www.musicxml.org/dtds/opus.dtd">
	
	The XML catalog at catalog.xml supports validating against a
	local copy of this DTD rather than the networked version in
	the system ID. Software often has trouble using system IDs
	due to factors such as restrictions on network access, or
	resources having moved from the original specified location.

<!-- Component DTD modules -->

<!--
	The common DTD module contains the entities and elements
	that are shared among multiple DTD modules.
-->
<!ENTITY % common PUBLIC
	"-//Recordare//ELEMENTS MusicXML 4.0 Common//EN"
	"common.mod">
%common;

<!--
	The link DTD module contains XLink attributes.
-->
<!ENTITY % link PUBLIC
	"-//Recordare//ELEMENTS MusicXML 4.0 Link//EN"
	"link.mod">
%link;

<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	Opus is the document element. The document-attributes
	entity includes the version attribute and is defined in
	the common.mod file.
-->
<!ELEMENT opus (title?, (opus | opus-link | score)*)>
<!ATTLIST opus
    %document-attributes;
>	

<!--
	The score elements provide the links to the individual 
	scores within an opus. The new-page attribute is used
	to indicate if the first page of the score is different
	than the last page of the previous score. If new-page is
	"yes", then a different page is used; if "no", then the
	same page is used. The default value is implementation-
	dependent.
-->
<!ELEMENT score EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST score
    %link-attributes;
    new-page %yes-no; #IMPLIED
>

<!--
	An opus-link provides a link to another opus document,
	allowing for multiple levels of opus collections via
	linking as well as nesting.
-->
<!ELEMENT opus-link EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST opus-link %link-attributes;>

<!--
	Future versions may include metadata elements. In
	this version, we just include the title of the opus.
-->
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
