<!--
	An opus collects MusicXML scores together into a larger
	entity. The individual scores could be movements in a
	symphony, scenes or acts in an opera, or songs in an
	album. The opus definition allows arbitrary nesting
	either via an opus (included in the document) or an
	opus-link (linked like scores). Future versions of
	MusicXML may expand this DTD to include reference
	data and other metadata related to musical scores.
	
	Suggested use:
