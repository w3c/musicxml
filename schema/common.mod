	The tenths entity is a number representing tenths of
	interline space (positive or negative) for use in
	attributes. The layout-tenths entity is the same for
	use in elements. Both integer and decimal values are
	allowed, such as 5 for a half space and 2.5 for a
	quarter space. Interline space is measured from the
	middle of a staff line.

<!ENTITY % tenths "CDATA">
<!ENTITY % layout-tenths "(#PCDATA)">

<!--
	The start-stop and start-stop-continue entities are used
	for musical elements that can either start or stop, such
	as slurs, tuplets, and wedges. The start-stop-continue
	entity is used when there is a need to refer to an
	intermediate point in the symbol, as for complex slurs
	or for specifying formatting of symbols across system
	breaks. The start-stop-single entity is used when the same
	element is used for multi-note and single-note notations,
	as for tremolos.

	The values of start, stop, and continue refer to how an
	element appears in musical score order, not in MusicXML
	document order. An element with a stop attribute may
	precede the corresponding element with a start attribute
	within a MusicXML document. This is particularly common
	in multi-staff music. For example, the stopping point for
	a slur may appear in staff 1 before the starting point for
	the slur appears in staff 2 later in the document.

	The up-down entity is used for arrow direction,
	indicating which way the tip is pointing.

<!ENTITY % number-of-lines "(0 | 1 | 2 | 3)">

<!--
	The enclosure-shape entity describes the shape and

<!--
	Slurs, tuplets, and many other features can be
	concurrent and overlapping within a single musical
	part. The number-level attribute distinguishes up to
	six concurrent objects of the same type. A reading
	program should be prepared to handle cases where
	the number-levels stop in an arbitrary order.
	Different numbers are needed when the features
	overlap in MusicXML document order. When a number-level
	value is implied, the value is 1 by default.

<!ENTITY % number-level "(1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6)">

<!--
	The MusicXML format supports eight levels of beaming, up
	to 1024th notes. Unlike the number-level attribute, the
	beam-level attribute identifies concurrent beams in a beam
	group. It does not distinguish overlapping beams such as
	grace notes within regular notes, or beams used in different
	voices.
-->
<!ENTITY % beam-level "(1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8)">

<!--
	The smufl-glyph-name entity is used for attributes that
	reference a specific Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL)
	character. The value is a SMuFL canonical glyph name,
	not a code point. For instance, the value for a standard
	piano pedal mark would be keyboardPedalPed, not U+E650.

<!--
	Common structures for formatting attribute definitions.
-->

<!--
	The position attributes are based on MuseData print
	suggestions. For most elements, any program will compute
	a default x and y position. The position attributes let
	this be changed two ways.

	The default-x and default-y attributes change the
	computation of the default position. For most elements,
	the origin is changed relative to the left-hand side of
	the note or the musical position within the bar (x) and
	the top line of the staff (y).

	For the following elements, the default-x value changes
	the origin relative to the start of the current measure:

		- note
		- figured-bass
		- harmony
		- link
		- directive
		- measure-numbering
		- all descendants of the part-list element
		- all children of the direction-type element

	This origin is from the start of the entire measure,
	at either the left barline or the start of the system.

	When the default-x attribute is used within a child element
	of the part-name-display, part-abbreviation-display,
	group-name-display, or group-abbreviation-display elements,
	it changes the origin relative to the start of the first
	measure on the system. These values are used when the current
	measure or a succeeding measure starts a new system. The same
	change of origin is used for the group-symbol element.

	For the note, figured-bass, and harmony elements, the
	default-x value is considered to have adjusted the musical
	position within the bar for its descendant elements.

	Since the credit-words and credit-image elements are not
	related to a measure, in these cases the default-x and
	default-y attributes adjust the origin relative to the
	bottom left-hand corner of the specified page.

	The relative-x and relative-y attributes change the position
	relative to the default position, either as computed by the
	individual program, or as overridden by the default-x and
	default-y attributes.

	Positive x is right, negative x is left; positive y is up,
	negative y is down. All units are in tenths of interline
	space. For stems, positive relative-y lengthens a stem
	while negative relative-y shortens it.

	The default-x and default-y position attributes provide
	higher-resolution positioning data than related features
	such as the placement attribute and the offset element.
	Applications reading a MusicXML file that can understand
	both features should generally rely on the default-x and
	default-y attributes for their greater accuracy. For the
	relative-x and relative-y attributes, the offset element,
	placement attribute, and directive attribute provide
	context for the relative position information, so the two
	features should be interpreted together.

	As elsewhere in the MusicXML format, tenths are the global
	tenths defined by the scaling element, not the local tenths
	of a staff resized by the staff-size element.

<!--
	The placement attribute indicates whether something is
	above or below another element, such as a note or a
	notation.
-->
<!ENTITY % placement
	"placement %above-below; #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The orientation attribute indicates whether slurs and
	ties are overhand (tips down) or underhand (tips up).
	This is distinct from the placement entity used by any
	notation type.
-->
<!ENTITY % orientation
	"orientation (over | under) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The directive entity changes the default-x position
	of a direction. It indicates that the left-hand side of the
	direction is aligned with the left-hand side of the time
	signature. If no time signature is present, it is aligned
	with the left-hand side of the first music notational
	element in the measure. If a default-x, justify, or halign
	attribute is present, it overrides the directive entity.
-->
<!ENTITY % directive
	"directive  %yes-no;  #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The bezier entity is used to indicate the curvature of
	slurs and ties, representing the control points for a
	cubic bezier curve. For ties, the bezier entity is
	used with the tied element.

	Normal slurs, S-shaped slurs, and ties need only two
	bezier points: one associated with the start of the slur
	or tie, the other with the stop. Complex slurs and slurs
	divided over system breaks can specify additional
	bezier data at slur elements with a continue type.

	The bezier-offset, bezier-x, and bezier-y attributes
	describe the outgoing bezier point for slurs and ties
	with a start type, and the incoming bezier point for
	slurs and ties with types of stop or continue. The
	attributes bezier-offset2, bezier-x2, and bezier-y2
	are only valid with slurs of type continue, and
	describe the outgoing bezier point.

	The bezier-offset and bezier-offset2 attributes are
	measured in terms of musical divisions, like the offset
	element. These are the recommended attributes for
	specifying horizontal position. The other attributes
	are specified in tenths, relative to any position
	settings associated with the slur or tied element.

<!--
	The font entity gathers together attributes for
	determining the font within a directive or direction.
	They are based on the text styles for Cascading
	Style Sheets. The font-family is a comma-separated list
	of font names. These can be specific font styles such
	as Maestro or Opus, or one of several generic font styles:
	music, engraved, handwritten, text, serif, sans-serif,
	handwritten, cursive, fantasy, and monospace. The music,
	engraved, and handwritten values refer to music fonts;
	the rest refer to text fonts. The fantasy style refers to
	decorative text such as found in older German-style
	printing. The font-style can be normal or italic. The
	font-size can be one of the CSS sizes (xx-small, x-small,
	small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large) or a numeric
	point size. The font-weight can be normal or bold. The
	default is application-dependent, but is a text font vs.
	a music font.

<!--
	The color entity indicates the color of an element.
	Color may be represented as hexadecimal RGB triples,
	as in HTML, or as hexadecimal ARGB tuples, with the
	A indicating alpha of transparency. An alpha value
	of 00 is totally transparent; FF is totally opaque.
	If RGB is used, the A value is assumed to be FF.

	For instance, the RGB value "#800080" represents
	purple. An ARGB value of "#40800080" would be a
	transparent purple.

	As in SVG 1.1, colors are defined in terms of the
	sRGB color space (IEC 61966).
-->
<!ENTITY % color
	"color CDATA #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The text-decoration entity is based on the similar
	feature in XHTML and CSS. It allows for text to
	be underlined, overlined, or struck-through. It
	extends the CSS version by allow double or
	triple lines instead of just being on or off.

	 overline  %number-of-lines;   #IMPLIED
	 line-through  %number-of-lines;   #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The justify entity is used to indicate left, center, or
	right justification. The default value varies for different
	elements. For elements where the justify attribute is present
	but the halign attribute is not, the justify attribute
	indicates horizontal alignment as well as justification.
-->
<!ENTITY % justify
	"justify (left | center | right) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	In cases where text extends over more than one line,
	horizontal alignment and justify values can be different.
	The most typical case is for credits, such as:

		Words and music by
		  Pat Songwriter

	Typically this type of credit is aligned to the right,
	so that the position information refers to the right-
	most part of the text. But in this example, the text
	is center-justified, not right-justified.

	The halign attribute is used in these situations. If it
	is not present, its value is the same as for the justify
	attribute.
-->
<!ENTITY % halign
	"halign (left | center | right) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The valign entity is used to indicate vertical
	alignment to the top, middle, bottom, or baseline
	of the text. Defaults are implementation-dependent.
-->
<!ENTITY % valign
	"valign (top | middle | bottom | baseline) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The valign-image entity is used to indicate vertical
	alignment for images and graphics, so it removes the
	baseline value. Defaults are implementation-dependent.

<!--
	The letter-spacing entity specifies text tracking.
	Values are either "normal" or a number representing
	the number of ems to add between each letter. The
	number may be negative in order to subtract space.
	The default is normal, which allows flexibility of
	letter-spacing for purposes of text justification.
-->
<!ENTITY % letter-spacing
	"letter-spacing CDATA #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The line-height entity specified text leading. Values
	are either "normal" or a number representing the
	percentage of the current font height  to use for
	leading. The default is "normal". The exact normal
	value is implementation-dependent, but values
	between 100 and 120 are recommended.
-->
<!ENTITY % line-height
	"line-height CDATA #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The text-direction entity is used to adjust and override
	the Unicode bidirectional text algorithm, similar to the
	W3C Internationalization Tag Set recommendation. Values
	are ltr (left-to-right embed), rtl (right-to-left embed),
	lro (left-to-right bidi-override), and rlo (right-to-left
	bidi-override). The default value is ltr. This entity
	is typically used by applications that store text in
	left-to-right visual order rather than logical order.
	Such applications can use the lro value to better
	communicate with other applications that more fully
	support bidirectional text.

<!--
	The text-rotation entity is used to rotate text
	around the alignment point specified by the
	halign and valign entities. The value is a number
	ranging from -180 to 180. Positive values are
	clockwise rotations, while negative values are
	counter-clockwise rotations.

	that overlap in different voices, or for chord sheets
	that contain lyrics and chords but no melody. For wholly
	invisible notes, such as those providing sound-only data,
	the attribute for print-spacing may be set to no so that
	no space is left for this note. The print-spacing value
	is only used if no note, dot, or lyric is being printed.

	By default, all these attributes are set to yes. If
	print-object is set to no, print-dot and print-lyric are

	Dynamics can be associated either with a note or a general
	musical direction. To avoid inconsistencies between and
	amongst the letter abbreviations for dynamics (what is sf
	vs. sfz, standing alone or with a trailing dynamic that is
	not always piano), we use the actual letters as the names
	of these dynamic elements. The other-dynamics element
	allows other dynamic marks that are not covered here, but
	many of those should perhaps be included in a more general
	musical direction element. Dynamics may also be combined as
	in <sf/><mp/>.

	These letter dynamic symbols are separated from crescendo,
	decrescendo, and wedge indications. Dynamic representation
	is inconsistent in scores. Many things are assumed by the
	composer and left out, such as returns to original dynamics.
	Systematic representations are quite complex: for example,
	Humdrum has at least 3 representation formats related to
	dynamics. The MusicXML format captures what is in the score,
	but does not try to be optimal for analysis or synthesis of
	dynamics.
