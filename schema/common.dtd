<!ENTITY % editorial "(footnote?, level?)">
<!ENTITY % editorial-voice "(footnote?, level?, voice?)">

<!--
	The start-stop and start-stop-continue entities are used 
	for musical elements that can either start or stop, such 
	as slurs, tuplets, and wedges. The start-stop-continue
	entity is used when there is a need to refer to an
	intermediate point in the symbol, as for complex slurs.
-->
<!ENTITY % start-stop "(start | stop)">
<!ENTITY % start-stop-continue "(start | stop | continue)">

<!--
	The yes-no entity is used for boolean-like attributes.
-->
<!ENTITY % yes-no "(yes | no)">

<!--
	The symbol-size entity is used to indicate full vs.
	cue-sized vs. oversized symbols. The large value
	for oversized symbols was added in version 1.1.
-->
<!ENTITY % symbol-size "(full | cue | large)">

<!--
	The up-down entity is used for arrow direction,
	indicating which way the tip is pointing.
-->
<!ENTITY % up-down "(up | down)">

<!--
	The top-bottom entity is used to indicate the top or
	bottom part of a vertical shape like non-arpeggiate.
-->
<!ENTITY % top-bottom "(top | bottom)">


<!--
	The position attributes are based on MuseData print
	suggestions. For most elements, any program will compute
	a default x and y position. The position attributes let
	this be changed two ways. 

	The default-x and default-y attributes change the 
	computation of the default position. For most elements,
	the origin is changed relative to the left-hand side of
	the note or the musical position within the bar (x) and
	the top line of the staff (y).

	For the following elements, the default-x value changes
	the origin relative to the start of the current measure:

		- note
		- figured-bass
		- harmony
		- link
		- directive
		- all descendants of the part-list element
		- all children of the direction-type element

	For the note, figured-bass, and harmony elements, the 
	default-x value is considered to have adjusted the 
	musical position within the bar for its descendant 
	elements.

	Since the <credit-words> element is not related to a
	measure, in this case the default-x and default-y 
	attributes adjust the origin relative to the bottom 
	left-hand corner of the first page.

	The relative-x and relative-y attributes change the 
	position relative to the default position, either as 
	computed by the individual program, or as overridden by 
	the default-x and default-y attributes.
	
	Positive x is right, negative x is left; positive y
	is up, negative y is down. All units are in tenths of
	interline space. For stems, positive relative-y 
	lengthens a stem while negative relative-y shortens it.

	As elsewhere in MusicXML, tenths are the global tenths 
	defined by the <scaling> element, not the local tenths
	of a staff resized by the <staff-size> element.

<!--
	The placement attribute indicates whether something is
	above or below another element, such as a note or a
	notation.
-->
<!ENTITY % placement
	"placement (above | below) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The orientation attribute indicates whether slurs and
	ties are overhand (tips down) or underhand (tips up).
	This is distinct from the placement entity used by any
	notation type.
-->
<!ENTITY % orientation
	"orientation (over | under) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The bezier entity is used to indicate the curvature of
	slurs and ties, representing the control points for a 
	cubic bezier curve. For ties, the bezier entity is 
	used with the tied element.

	Normal slurs, S-shaped slurs, and ties need only two 
	bezier points: one associated with the start of the slur 
	or tie, the other with the stop. Complex slurs and slurs 
	divided over system breaks can specify additional 
	bezier data at slur elements with a continue type.
	
	The bezier-offset, bezier-x, and bezier-y attributes
	describe the outgoing bezier point for slurs and ties 
	with a start type, and the incoming bezier point for
	slurs and ties with types of stop or continue. The 
	attributes bezier-offset2, bezier-x2, and bezier-y2 
	are only valid with slurs of type continue, and 
	describe the outgoing bezier point.
	
	The bezier-offset and bezier-offset2 attributes are
	measured in terms of musical divisions, like the offset
	element. These are the recommended attributes for
	specifying horizontal position. The other attributes
	are specified in tenths, relative to any position 
	settings associated with the slur or tied element.

<!--
	Slurs, tuplets, and many other features can be
	concurrent and overlapping within a single musical
	part. The number-level attribute distinguishes up to
	six concurrent objects of the same type. A reading
	program should be prepared to handle cases where
	the number-levels stop in an arbitrary order.
	Different numbers are needed when the features
	overlap in MusicXML file order.
-->
<!ENTITY % number-level "(1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6)">

<!--
	MusicXML supports six levels of beaming, up to 256th 
	notes. Unlike the number-level attribute, the beam-level
	identifies concurrent beams in a beam group. It does not
	distinguish overlapping beams such as grace notes within
	regular notes, or beams used in different voices.
-->
<!ENTITY % beam-level "(1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6)">

<!--
	The font entity gathers together attributes for
	determining the font within a directive or direction.
	They are based on the text styles for Cascading
	Style Sheets. The font-family is a comma-separated list
	of font names. These can be specific font styles such
	as Maestro or Opus, or one of three generic font styles:
	music, serif, or sans-serif. The font-style can be 
	normal or italic. The font-size can be one of the CSS 
	sizes (xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large,
	xx-large) or a numeric point size. The font-weight can 
	be normal or bold. The default is application-dependent,
	but is a text font vs. a music font.

<!--
	The color entity indicates the color of an element.
	Color may be represented as hexadecimal RGB triples,
	as in HTML, or as hexadecimal ARGB tuples, with the
	A indicating alpha of transparency. An alpha value
	of 00 is totally transparent; FF is totally opaque.
	If RGB is used, the A value is assumed to be FF. 

	For instance, the RGB value "#800080" represents
	purple. An ARGB value of "#40800080" would be a
	transparent purple.

	As in SVG 1.1, colors are defined in terms of the
	sRGB color space (IEC 61966).
-->
<!ENTITY % color
	"color CDATA #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The justify entity is used to indicate left, center,
	or right justification. The default value varies for
	different elements.
-->
<!ENTITY % justify
	"justify (left | center | right) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	In cases where text extends over more than one line, 
	horizontal alignment and justify values can be 
	different. The most typical case is for credits, 
	such as:

		Words and music by
		  Pat Songwriter

	Typically this type of credit is aligned to the right,
	so that the position information refers to the right-
	most part of the text. But in this example, the text 
	is center-justified, not right-justified.

	The halign attribute is used in these situations. If it 
	is not present, its value is the same as for the justify
	attribute.
-->
<!ENTITY % halign
	"halign (left | center | right) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The valign entity is used to indicate vertical
	alignment to the top, middle, bottom, or baseline 
	of the text. Defaults are implementation-dependent.
-->
<!ENTITY % valign
	"valign (top | middle | bottom | baseline) #IMPLIED">

	is position, font, and color.

<!--
	The line-shape entity is used to distinguish between
	straight and curved lines. The line-type entity
	distinguishes between solid, dashed, dotted, and
	wavy lines.
-->

	"line-shape (straight | curved) #IMPLIED">

<!ENTITY % line-type

<!--
	The printout entity is based on MuseData print
	suggestions. They allow a way to specify not to print
	print an object (e.g. note or rest), its augmentation
	dots, or its lyrics. This is especially useful for notes 
	that overlap in different voices, or for chord sheets
	that contain lyrics and chords but no melody. For wholly
	invisible notes, such as those providing sound-only data,
	the attribute for print-spacing may be set to no so that
	no space is left for this note. The print-spacing value
	is only used if no note, dot, or lyric is being printed.

	By default, all these attributes are set to yes. If 
	print-object is set to no, print-dot and print-lyric are
	interpreted to also be set to no if they are not present.

<!--
	The trill-sound entity includes attributes used to guide
	the sound of trills, mordents, turns, shakes, and wavy
	lines, based on MuseData sound suggestions. The default
	choices are:
	
		start-note = "upper"
		trill-step = "whole"
		two-note-turn = "none"
		accelerate = "no"
		beats = "4" (minimum of "2").
	
	Second-beat and last-beat are percentages for landing
	on the indicated beat, with defaults of 25 and 75
	respectively.
	
	For mordent and inverted-mordent elements, the defaults
	are different:
	
		The default start-note is "main", not "upper".
		The default for beats is "3", not "4".
		The default for second-beat is "12", not "25".
		The default for last-beat is "24", not "75".

<!--
	The bend-sound entity is used for bend and slide
	elements, and is similar to the trill-sound. Here the
	beats element refers to the number of discrete elements
	(like MIDI pitch bends) used to represent a continuous
	bend or slide. The first-beat indicates the percentage
	of the direction for starting a bend; the last-beat the
	percentage for ending it. The default choices are:
	
		accelerate = "no"
		beats = "4" (minimum of "2")
		first-beat = "25"
		last-beat = "75"

	reference attribute for the level element is yes,
	this indicates editorial information that is for 
	display only and should not affect playback. For

	representation is basically inconsistent in scores
	(lots of things are assumed by the composer and left out,
