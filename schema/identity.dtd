<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	Identification contains basic metadata about the score.
	It includes the information in MuseData headers that
	may apply at a score-wide, movement-wide, or part-wide
	level. The creator and rights elements are based on
	Dublin Core.
-->
<!ELEMENT identification (creator*, rights*, encoding?,
	source?, miscellaneous?)>

<!--
	Creator is borrowed from Dublin Core. It is the composer
	of the score (the artist field in NIFF). The type
	attribute can be used to distinguish words and music so
	as to represent lyricists and librettists as well as
	composers. Thus, there can be multiple creators in an
	identification. We do not use the creator / contributor
	distinction from Dublin Core.

<!--
	Rights is borrowed from Dublin Core. It contains
	copyright and other intellectual property notices.
	Words, music, and derivatives can have different types,
	so multiple rights tags with different type attributes
	are supported.

<!--
	Encoding contains information about who did the digital
	encoding, when, with what software, and in what aspects.
	The supports element indicates if the encoding supports
	a particular MusicXML element. This is recommended for
	elements like beam, stem, and accidental, where the
	absence of an element is ambiguous if you do not know
	if the encoding supports that element.
