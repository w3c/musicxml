<!--
	If a barline is other than a normal single barline, it
	should be represented by a barline element that describes
	it. This includes information about repeats and multiple
	endings, as well as line style. Barline data is on the same
	level as the other musical data in a score - a child of a
	measure in a partwise score, or a part in a timewise score.
	This allows for barlines within measures, as in dotted
	barlines that subdivide measures in complex meters. The two
	fermata elements allow for fermatas on both sides of the
	barline (the lower one inverted).
	
	Barlines have a location attribute to make it easier to
	process barlines independently of the other musical data
	in a score. It is often easier to set up measures
	separately from entering notes. The location attribute
	must match where the barline element occurs within the
	rest of the musical data in the score. If location is left,
	it should be the first element in the measure, aside from
	the print, bookmark, and link elements. If location is
	right, it should be the last element, again with the
	possible exception of the print, bookmark, and link
	elements. If no location is specified, the right barline
	is the default. The segno, coda, and divisions attributes
	work the same way as in the sound element defined in the
	direction.mod file. They are used for playback when barline
	elements contain segno or coda child elements.

	Endings refers to multiple (e.g. first and second) endings.
	Typically, the start type is associated with the left
	barline of the first measure in an ending. The stop and
	discontinue types are associated with the right barline of
	the last measure in an ending. Stop is used when the ending
	mark concludes with a downward jog, as is typical for first
	endings. Discontinue is used when there is no downward jog,
	as is typical for second endings that do not conclude a
	piece. The length of the jog can be specified using the
	end-length attribute. The text-x and text-y attributes
	are offsets that specify where the baseline of the start
	of the ending text appears, relative to the start of the
	ending line.

	The number attribute indicates which times the ending is
	played, similar to the time-only attribute used by other
	elements. While this often represents the numeric values for
	what is under the ending line, it can also indicate whether
	an ending is played during a larger dal segno or da capo
	repeat. Single endings such as "1" or comma-separated
	multiple endings such as "1, 2" may be used. The ending
	element text is used when the text displayed in the ending
	is different than what appears in the number attribute. The
	print-object attribute is used to indicate when an ending is
	present but not printed, as is often the case for many parts
	in a full score.

	The repeat element represents repeat marks. The start of
	the repeat has a forward direction while the end of the
	repeat has a backward direction. The times and after-jump
	attributes are only used with backward repeats that are not
	part of an ending. The times attribute indicates the number
	of times the repeated section is played. The after-jump
	attribute indicates if the repeats are played after a
	jump due to a da capo or dal segno. The winged attribute
	indicates whether the repeat has winged extensions that
	appear above and below the barline. The straight and curved
	values represent single wings, while the double-straight and
	double-curved values represent double wings. The none value
	indicates no wings and is the default.
