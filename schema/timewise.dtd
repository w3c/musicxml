<!--
	The MusicXML format is designed to represent musical scores,
	specifically common western musical notation from the 17th
	century onwards. It is designed as an interchange format
	for notation, analysis, retrieval, and performance
	applications. Therefore it is intended to be sufficient,
	not optimal, for these applications.
	
	The MusicXML format is based on the MuseData and Humdrum
	formats. Humdrum explicitly represents the two-dimensional
	nature of musical scores by a 2-D layout notation. Since the
	XML format is hierarchical, we cannot do this explicitly.
	Instead, there are two top-level formats:
	
	partwise.dtd   Represents scores by part/instrument
	timewise.dtd   Represents scores by time/measure
	
	Thus partwise.dtd contains measures within each part,
	while timewise.dtd contains parts within each measure.
	XSLT stylesheets are provided to convert between the
	two formats.
	
	The partwise and timewise score DTDs represent a single 
	movement of music. Multiple movements or other musical 
	collections are presented using opus.dtd. An opus
	document contains XLinks to individual scores.
	
	Suggested use:
	
	<!DOCTYPE score-timewise PUBLIC
		"-//Recordare//DTD MusicXML 4.0 Timewise//EN"
		"http://www.musicxml.org/dtds/timewise.dtd">
	
	This DTD is made up of a series of component DTD modules,
	all of which are included here.
		
	The XML catalog at catalog.xml supports validating against a
	local copy of this DTD rather than the networked version in
	the system ID. Software often has trouble using system IDs
	due to factors such as restrictions on network access, or
	resources having moved from the original specified location.

<!-- Entities -->

<!--
	The partwise and timewise entities are used with
	conditional sections to control the differences between
	the partwise and timewise DTDs. The values for these
	entities are what distinguish the partwise and timewise
	DTD files.
