<!--
	Credit elements refer to the title, composer, arranger,
	lyricist, copyright, dedication, and other text, symbols,
	and graphics that commonly appear on the first page of a
	score. The credit-words, credit-symbol, and credit-image
	elements are similar to the words, symbol, and image
	elements for directions. However, since the credit is not
	part of a measure, the default-x and default-y attributes
	adjust the origin relative to the bottom left-hand corner
	of the page. The  enclosure for credit-words and
	credit-symbol is none by default.

	By default, a series of credit-words and credit-symbol
	elements within a single credit element follow one another
	in sequence visually. Non-positional formatting attributes
	are carried over from the previous element by default.

	The page attribute for the credit element specifies the page
	number where the credit should appear. This is an integer
	value that starts with 1 for the first page. Its value is 1
	by default. Since credits occur before the music, these page
	numbers do not refer to the page numbering specified by the
	print element's page-number attribute.

	The credit-type element indicates the purpose behind a
	credit. Multiple types of data may be combined in a single
	credit, so multiple elements may be used. Standard values
	include page number, title, subtitle, composer, arranger,
	lyricist, rights, and part name.

<!--
	The part-list identifies the different musical parts in
	this document. Each part has an ID that is used later
	within the musical data. Since parts may be encoded
	separately and combined later, identification elements
	are present at both the score and score-part levels.
	There must be at least one score-part, combined as
	desired with part-group elements that indicate braces
	and brackets. Parts are ordered from top to bottom in
	a score based on the order in which they appear in the
	part-list.
	
	Often each MusicXML part corresponds to a track in a
	Standard MIDI Format 1 file. In this case, the midi-device
	element is used to make a MIDI device or port assignment
	for the given track or specific MIDI instruments. Initial
	midi-instrument assignments may be made here as well. The
	score-instrument elements are used when there are multiple
	instruments per track.

	The part-name-display and part-abbreviation-display
	elements are defined in the common.mod file, as they can
	be used within both the score-part and print elements.

<!--
	The part-link element allows MusicXML data for both score
	and parts to be contained within a single compressed
	MusicXML file. It links a score-part from a score document
	to MusicXML documents that contain parts data. In the case
	of a single compressed MusicXML file, the link href values
	are paths that are relative to the root folder of the zip 
	file.
	
	Multiple part-link elements can link a condensed part within
	a score document to multiple MusicXML parts documents. For
	example, a "Clarinet 1 and 2" part in a score document could
	link to separate "Clarinet 1" and "Clarinet 2" part documents.
	The optional instrument-link elements distinguish which of
	the score-instruments within a score-part are in which
	part document. The instrument-link id attribute refers to a
	score-instrument id attribute.
	
	Multiple part-link elements can reference different types
	of linked documents, such as parts and condensed score. The
	optional group-link elements identify the groups used in
	the linked document. The content of a group-link element
	should match the content of a group element in the linked
	document.

	precede the other systems. The formatting attributes for
	these elements are deprecated in Version 2.0 in favor of
	the new part-name-display and part-abbreviation-display
	elements. These are defined in the common.mod file as they

<!--
	The part-group element indicates groupings of parts in the
	score, usually indicated by braces and brackets. Braces
	that are used for multi-staff parts should be defined in
	the attributes element for that part. The part-group start
	element appears before the first score-part in the group.
	The part-group stop element appears after the last 
	score-part in the group.
	
	The number attribute is used to distinguish overlapping
	and nested part-groups, not the sequence of groups. As
	with parts, groups can have a name and abbreviation.
	Formatting attributes for group-name and group-abbreviation
	are deprecated in Version 2.0 in favor of the new
	group-name-display and group-abbreviation-display elements.
	Formatting specified in the group-name-display and
	group-abbreviation-display elements overrides formatting
	specified in the group-name and group-abbreviation
	elements, respectively.

	The group-symbol element indicates how the symbol for
	a group is indicated in the score. Values include none,
	brace, line, bracket, and square; the default is none.
	The group-barline element indicates if the group should
	have common barlines. Values can be yes, no, or
	Mensurstrich. The group-time element indicates that the
	displayed time signatures should stretch across all parts
	and staves in the group. Values for the child elements
	are ignored at the stop of a group. 

	A part-group element is not needed for a single multi-staff
	part. By default, multi-staff parts include a brace symbol
	and (if appropriate given the bar-style) common barlines.
	The symbol formatting for a multi-staff part can be more
	fully specified using the part-symbol element, defined in
	the attributes.mod file.

	The score-instrument element allows for multiple instruments
	per score-part. As with the score-part element, each
	score-instrument has a required ID attribute, a name,
	and an optional abbreviation. The instrument-name and
	instrument-abbreviation are typically used within a software
	application, rather than appearing on the printed page of a
	score.

	A score-instrument element is also required if the score
	specifies MIDI 1.0 channels, banks, or programs. An initial
	midi-instrument assignment can also be made here. MusicXML
	software should be able to automatically assign reasonable
	channels and instruments without these elements in simple
	cases, such as where part names match General MIDI
	instrument names.
	
	The score-instrument element can also distinguish multiple
	instruments of the same type that are on the same part,
	such as Clarinet 1 and Clarinet 2 instruments within a
	Clarinets 1 and 2 part.

	The virtual-instrument-data entity is defined in the

	In either format, the part element has an id attribute that

	The implicit attribute is set to "yes" for measures where
	the measure number should never appear, such as pickup
	measures and the last half of mid-measure repeats. The
	value is "no" if not specified.
	
	The non-controlling attribute is intended for use in
	multimetric music like the Don Giovanni minuet. If set
	to "yes", the left barline in this measure does not
	coincide with the left barline of measures in other
	parts. The value is "no" if not specified. 

	In partwise files, the number attribute should be the same
	for measures in different parts that share the same left
	barline. While the number attribute is often numeric, it
	does not have to be. Non-numeric values are typically used
	together with the implicit or non-controlling attributes
	being set to "yes". For a pickup measure, the number
	attribute is typically set to "0" and the implicit attribute
	is typically set to "yes". 

	If measure numbers are not unique within a part, this can
	cause problems for conversions between partwise and timewise
	formats. The text attribute allows specification of displayed
	measure numbers that are different than what is used in the
	number attribute. This attribute is ignored for measures
	where the implicit attribute is set to "yes". The text
	attribute for a measure element has at least one character.
	Further details about measure numbering can be specified
	using the measure-numbering element defined in the
	direction.mod file.

	Measure width is specified in tenths. These are the
	global tenths specified in the scaling element, not
	local tenths as modified by the staff-size element.
	The width covers the entire measure from barline
