	The identify DTD module contains the identification

	score.

<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	Identification contains basic metadata about the score.
	It includes information that may apply at a score-wide,
	movement-wide, or part-wide level. The creator, rights,
	source, and relation elements are based on Dublin Core.
-->
<!ELEMENT identification (creator*, rights*, encoding?,
	source?, relation*, miscellaneous?)>

<!--
	The creator element is borrowed from Dublin Core. It is
	used for the creators of the score. The type attribute is
	used to distinguish different creative contributions. Thus,
	there can be multiple creators within an identification.
	Standard type values are composer, lyricist, and arranger.
	Other type values may be used for different types of
	creative roles. The type attribute should usually be used
	even if there is just a single creator element. The MusicXML
	format does not use the creator / contributor distinction
	from Dublin Core.

<!--
	Rights is borrowed from Dublin Core. It contains copyright
	and other intellectual property notices. Words, music, and
	derivatives can have different types, so multiple rights
	elements with different type attributes are supported.
	Standard type values are music, words, and arrangement, but
	other types may be used. The type attribute is only needed
	when there are multiple rights elements.

<!ATTLIST rights

<!--
	Encoding contains information about who did the digital
	encoding, when, with what software, and in what aspects.
	Standard type values for the encoder element are music,
	words, and arrangement, but other types may be used. The
	type attribute is only needed when there are multiple
	encoder elements.

	The supports element indicates if the encoding supports
	a particular MusicXML element. This is recommended for
	elements like beam, stem, and accidental, where the
	absence of an element is ambiguous if you do not know
	if the encoding supports that element. For Version 2.0,
	the supports element is expanded to allow programs to
	indicate support for particular attributes or particular
	values. This lets applications communicate, for example,
	that all system and/or page breaks are contained in the
	MusicXML file.
