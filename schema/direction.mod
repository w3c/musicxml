	This direction DTD module contains the direction element
	and its children. Directions are generally not note-specific,
	but instead are associated with a part or the overall score.
	
	Harmony indications and general print and sound
	suggestions are likewise not necessarily attached to
	particular note elements, and are included here as well.
-->

<!-- Entities -->

<!--
	The harmony-arrangement entity indicates how stacked chords
	and bass notes are displayed within a harmony element. The
	vertical value specifies that the second element appears
	below the first. The horizontal value specifies that the
	second element appears to the right of the first. The 
	diagonal value specifies that the second element appears
	both below and to the right of the first.

<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	A direction is a musical indication that is not necessarily
	attached to a specific note. Two or more may be combined to
	indicate words followed by the start of a dashed line, the
	end of a wedge followed by dynamics, etc. For applications
	where a specific direction is indeed attached to a specific
	note, the direction element can be associated with the first
	note element that follows it in score order that is not in a
	different voice.

	By default, a series of direction-type elements and a 
	series of child elements of a direction-type within a 
	single direction element follow one another in sequence
	visually. For a series of direction-type children, non-
	positional formatting attributes are carried over from
	the previous element by default.

	The pedal element represents piano pedal marks, including
	damper and sostenuto pedal marks. The soft pedal is not
	included here because there is no special symbol or graphic
	used for it beyond what can be specified with words and
	bracket elements.
	
	The start type indicates the start of a damper pedal, while
	the sostenuto type indicates the start of a sostenuto pedal.
	The other types can be used with either the damper or
	sostenuto pedal.

	The line attribute is yes if pedal lines are used. The sign
	attribute is yes if Ped, Sost, and * signs are used. For
	compatibility with older versions, the sign attribute is yes
	by default if the line attribute is no, and is no by default
	if the line attribute is yes. If the sign attribute is set
	to yes and the type is start or sostenuto, the abbreviated
	attribute is yes if the short P and S signs are used, and
	no if the full Ped and Sost signs are used. It is no by
	default. Otherwise the abbreviated attribute is ignored.
	The alignment attributes are ignored if the sign attribute
	is no.

	The change, continue, discontinue, and resume types are used
	when the line attribute is yes. The change type indicates a
	pedal lift and retake indicated with an inverted V marking.
	The continue type allows more precise formatting across
	system breaks and for more complex pedaling lines. The
	discontinue type indicates the end of a pedal line that does
	not include the explicit lift represented by the stop type.
	The resume type indicates the start of a pedal line that
	does not include the downstroke represented by the start
	type. It can be used when a line resumes after being
	discontinued, or to start a pedal line that is preceded
	by a text or symbol representation of the pedal.

	Metronome marks and other metric relationships.
	
	The beat-unit values are the same as for a type element,
	and the beat-unit-dot works like the dot element. The
	beat-unit-tied type indicates a beat-unit that is tied to
	the preceding beat-unit. The per-minute element can be a
	number, or a text description including numbers. The
	parentheses attribute indicates whether or not to put the
	metronome mark in parentheses; its value is no if not
	specified. The print-object attribute is set to no in
	cases where the metronome element represents a relationship
	or range that is not displayed in the music notation.
	
	If a font is specified for the per-minute element,
	it overrides the font specified for the overall metronome
	element. This allows separate specification of a music font
	for beat-unit and a text font for the numeric value in cases
	where a single metronome font is not used.

	The metronome-note and metronome-relation elements allow
	for the specification of metric modulations and other metric
	relationships, such as swing tempo marks where two eighths
	are equated to a quarter note / eighth note triplet. If the
	metronome-arrows element is present, it indicates that metric
	modulation arrows are displayed on both sides of the metronome
	mark. The metronome-type, metronome-beam, metronome-dot, and
	metronome-tied elements work like the type, beam, dot, and tied
	elements. The metronome-tuplet element uses the same element
	structure as the time-modification element along with some
	attributes from the tuplet element. The metronome-relation
	element describes the relationship symbol that goes between the
	two sets of metronome-note elements. The currently allowed
	value is equals, but this may expand in future versions.
	If the element is empty, the equals value is used. The 
	metronome-relation and the following set of metronome-note
	elements are optional to allow display of an isolated
	Grundschlagnote.

<!-- Harmony -->

<!--
	The harmony element represents harmony analysis, including
	chord symbols in popular music as well as functional harmony
	analysis in classical music.
	
	If there are alternate harmonies possible, this can be
	specified using multiple harmony elements differentiated
	by type. Explicit harmonies have all note present in the
	music; implied have some notes missing but implied;
	alternate represents alternate analyses. 
	
	The print-object attribute controls whether or not anything
	is printed due to the harmony element. The print-frame
	attribute controls printing of a frame or fretboard diagram.
	The print-style entity sets the default for the harmony,
	but individual elements can override this with their own
	print-style values.
	
	A harmony element can contain many stacked chords (e.g.
	V of II). A sequence of harmony-chord entities is used for
	this type of secondary function, where V of II would be
	represented by a harmony-chord with a 5 numeral followed by
	a harmony-chord with a 2 numeral. The arrangement attribute
	specifies how multiple harmony-chord entities are arranged
	relative to each other. Harmony-chords with vertical
	arrangement are separated by horizontal lines. Harmony-
	chords with diagonal or horizontal arrangement are separated
	by diagonal lines or slashes.

	A root is a pitch name like C, D, E, while a numeral is
	a scale degree like 1, 2, 3. The root element is generally
	used with pop chord symbols, while the numeral element
	is generally used with classical functional harmony and
	Nashville numbers. It is an either/or choice to avoid data
	inconsistency. The function element, which represents Roman

	MusicXML 4.0.

	The root element has a root-step and optional root-alter 
	element similar to the step and alter elements in a pitch,
	but renamed to distinguish the different musical meanings.
	The root-step text attribute indicates how the root should
	appear in a score if not using the element contents.
	In some chord styles, this will include the root-alter
	information as well. In that case, the print-object

	The numeral element represents the Roman numeral or 
	Nashville number part of a harmony. It requires that the
	key be specified in the encoding, either with a key or
	numeral-key element.
	
	The numeral-root element represents the Roman numeral or
	Nashville number as a positive integer from 1 to 7. The
	text attribute indicates how the numeral should appear in
	the score. A numeral-root value of 5 with a kind of major
	would have a text attribute of "V" if displayed as a Roman
	numeral, and "5" if displayed as a Nashville number. If the
	text attribute is not specified, the display is application-
	dependent.
	
	The numeral-alter element represents an alteration to the
	numeral-root, similar to the alter element for a pitch.
	The print-object attribute can be used to hide an alteration
	in cases such as when the MusicXML encoding of a 6 or 7
	numeral-root in a minor key requires an alteration that
	is not displayed. The location attribute indicates whether
	the alteration should appear to the left or the right of
	the numeral-root; it is left by default.
	
	The numeral-key element is used when the key for the numeral
	is different than the key specified by the key signature.
	The numeral-fifths element specifies the key in the same way
	as the fifths element. The numeral-mode element specifies
	the mode similar to the mode element, but with a restricted
	set of values: major, minor, natural minor, melodic minor,
	and harmonic minor. The different minor values are used to
	interpret numeral-root values of 6 and 7 when present in
	a minor key. The harmonic minor value sharpens the 7 and
	the melodic minor value sharpens both 6 and 7. If a minor
	mode is used without qualification, either in the mode or
	numeral-mode elements, natural minor is used.

	Other:
	    pedal (pedal-point bass)
	    power (perfect fifth)
	    Tristan
	
	The "other" kind is used when the harmony is entirely
	composed of add elements. 
	
	The "none" kind is used to explicitly encode absence of
	chords or functional harmony. In this case, the root,
	numeral, or function element has no meaning. When using
	the root or numeral element, the root-step or numeral-step
	text attribute should be set to the empty string to keep
	the root or numeral from being displayed.

	The attributes are used to indicate the formatting
	of the symbol. Since the kind element is the constant
	in all the harmony-chord entities that can make up
	a polychord, many formatting attributes are here.

	The use-symbols attribute is yes if the kind should be
	represented when possible with harmony symbols rather
	than letters and numbers. These symbols include:

	    major: a triangle, like Unicode 25B3
	    minor: -, like Unicode 002D
	    augmented: +, like Unicode 002B
	    diminished: Â°, like Unicode 00B0
	    half-diminished: Ã¸, like Unicode 00F8

	For the major-minor kind, only the minor symbol is used when
	use-symbols is yes. The major symbol is set using the symbol
	attribute in the degree-value element. The corresponding
	degree-alter value will usually be 0 in this case.

	The text attribute describes how the kind should be spelled
	in a score. If use-symbols is yes, the value of the text
	attribute follows the symbol. The stack-degrees attribute
	is yes if the degree elements should be stacked above each
	other. The parentheses-degrees attribute is yes if all the
	degrees should be in parentheses. The bracket-degrees 
	attribute is yes if all the degrees should be in a bracket.
	If not specified, these values are implementation-specific.
	The alignment attributes are for the entire harmony-chord
	entity of which this kind element is a part.
	
	The text attribute may use strings such as "13sus" that
	refer to both the kind and one or more degree elements.
	In this case, the corresponding degree elements should
	have the print-object attribute set to "no" to keep 
	redundant alterations from being displayed.

	is like the alter element in notes: 1 for sharp, -1 for
	flat, etc. The degree-type element can be add, alter, or
	subtract. If the degree-type is alter or subtract, the
	degree-alter is relative to the degree already in the
	chord based on its kind element. If the degree-type is
	add, the degree-alter is relative to a dominant chord
	(major and perfect intervals except for a minor 
	seventh). The print-object attribute can be used to

	alteration. It is no if not specified.

	The sound element contains general playback parameters.
	They can stand alone within a part/measure, or be a
	component element within a direction.
	
	Tempo is expressed in quarter notes per minute. If 0,
	the sound-generating program should prompt the user at the
	time of compiling a sound (MIDI) file.
	
	Dynamics (or MIDI velocity) are expressed as a percentage
	of the default forte value (90 for MIDI 1.0).
	
	Dacapo indicates to go back to the beginning of the
	movement. When used it always has the value "yes".
	
	Segno and dalsegno are used for backwards jumps to a
	segno sign; coda and tocoda are used for forward jumps
	to a coda sign. If there are multiple jumps, the value
	of these parameters can be used to name and distinguish
	them. If segno or coda is used, the divisions attribute
	can also be used to indicate the number of divisions
	per quarter note. Otherwise sound and MIDI generating
	programs may have to recompute this.
	
	By default, a dalsegno or dacapo attribute indicates that
	the jump should occur the first time through, while a 
	tocoda attribute indicates the jump should occur the second
	time through. The time that jumps occur can be changed by
	using the time-only attribute.
	
	The forward-repeat attribute indicates that a forward
	repeat sign is implied but not displayed. It is used for
	example in two-part forms with repeats, such as a minuet
	and trio where no repeat is displayed at the start of the
	trio. This usually occurs after a barline. When used it
	always has the value of "yes".
	
	The fine attribute follows the final note or rest in a
	movement with a da capo or dal segno direction. If numeric,
	the value represents the actual duration of the final note or
	rest, which can be ambiguous in written notation and 
	different among parts and voices. The value may also be 
	"yes" to indicate no change to the final duration.
	
	If the sound element applies only particular times through a
	repeat, the time-only attribute indicates which times to apply
	the sound element. The value is a comma-separated list of
	positive integers arranged in ascending order, indicating
	which times through the repeated section that the element
	applies.
	
	Pizzicato in a sound element effects all following notes.
	Yes indicates pizzicato, no indicates arco.

	The pan and elevation attributes are deprecated in 
	Version 2.0. The pan and elevation elements in
	the midi-instrument element should be used instead.
	The meaning of the pan and elevation attributes is
	the same as for the pan and elevation elements. If
	both are present, the mid-instrument elements take
	priority.
	
	The damper-pedal, soft-pedal, and sostenuto-pedal 
	attributes effect playback of the three common piano
	pedals and their MIDI controller equivalents. The yes
	value indicates the pedal is depressed; no indicates 
	the pedal is released. A numeric value from 0 to 100
	may also be used for half pedaling. This value is the
	percentage that the pedal is depressed. A value of 0 is
	equivalent to no, and a value of 100 is equivalent to yes.
	
	Instrument changes, MIDI devices, MIDI instruments, and
	playback techniques are changed using the instrument-change
	element and elements defined in the common.mod file. When
	there are multiple instances of these elements, they should
	be grouped together by instrument using the id attribute
	values.

	place offset from the current score position. If the sound
	element is a child of a direction element, the sound offset

<!--
	The swing element specifies whether or not to use swing
	playback, where consecutive on-beat / off-beat eighth or 
	16th notes are played with unequal nominal durations. 
	
	The straight element specifies that no swing is present,
	so consecutive notes have equal durations.
	
	The first and second elements are positive integers that 
	specify the ratio between durations of consecutive notes.
	For example, a first element with a value of 2 and a second
	element with a value of 1 applied to eighth notes specifies
	a quarter note / eighth note tuplet playback, where the
	first note is twice as long as the second note. Ratios
	should be specified with the smallest integers possible.
	For example, a ratio of 6 to 4 should be specified as 3 to 2
	instead.
	
	The optional swing-type element specifies the note type, 
	either eighth or 16th, to which the ratio is applied. The
	value is eighth if this element is not present.
	
	The optional swing-style element is a string describing the
	style of swing used.

	The swing element has no effect for playback of grace notes,
	notes where a type element is not present, and notes where
	the specified duration is different than the nominal value
	associated with the specified type. If a swung note has
	attack and release attributes, those values modify the
	swung playback.

	The listen and listening elements, new in Version 4.0,
	specify different ways that a score following or machine
	listening application can interact with a performer. The
	listening element handles interactions that change the state
	of the listening application from the specified point in
	the performance onward. If multiple child elements of the
	same type are present, they should have distinct player
	and/or time-only attributes.
	
	The offset element is used to indicate that the listening
	change takes place offset from the current score position.
	If the listening element is a child of a direction element,
	the listening offset element overrides the direction offset
	element if both elements are present. Note that the offset
	reflects the intended musical position for the change in
	state. It should not be used to compensate for latency
	issues in particular hardware configurations.

<!-- 
	The sync element specifies the style that a score following
	application should use to synchronize an accompaniment with
	a performer. The none type indicates no synchronization to
	the performer. The tempo type indicates synchronization
	based on the performer tempo rather than individual events
	in the score. The event type indicates synchronization by
	following the performance of individual events in the score
	rather than the performer tempo. The mostly-tempo and
	mostly-event types combine these two approaches, with
	mostly-tempo giving more weight to tempo and mostly-event
	giving more weight to performed events. The always-event
	type provides the strictest synchronization by not being
	forgiving of missing performed events. If this element is
	not included in a score, default synchronization depends
	on the application.
	
	The optional latency attribute specifies a time in 
	milliseconds that the listening application should expect
	from the performer. The optional player and time-only
	attributes restrict the element to apply to a single player
	or set of times through a repeated section, respectively.
