<!--
	The common note elements between cue/grace notes and
	regular (full) notes: pitch, chord, and rest information,
	but not duration (cue and grace notes do not have
	duration encoded here). Unpitched elements are used for
	unpitched percussion, speaking voice, and other musical
	elements lacking determinate pitch.

<!--
	Notes are the most common type of MusicXML data. The
	MusicXML format keeps the MuseData distinction between
	elements used for sound information and elements used for
	notation information (e.g., tie is used for sound, tied for
	notation). Thus grace notes do not have a duration element.
	Cue notes have a duration element, as do forward elements,
	but no tie elements. Having these two types of information
	available can make interchange considerably easier, as
	some programs handle one type of information much more
	readily than the other.

	The position and printout entities for printing suggestions
	are defined in the common.mod file.

	The dynamics and end-dynamics attributes correspond to
	MIDI 1.0's Note On and Note Off velocities, respectively.
	They are expressed in terms of percentages of the default
	forte value (90 for MIDI 1.0).

	The attack and release attributes are used to alter the
	starting and stopping time of the note from when it would
	otherwise occur based on the flow of durations - information
	that is specific to a performance. They are expressed in
	terms of divisions, either positive or negative. A note that
	starts a tie should not have a release attribute, and a note
	that stops a tie should not have an attack attribute. The
	attack and release attributes are independent of each other.
	The attack attribute only changes the starting time of a
	note, and the release attribute only changes the stopping
	time of a note.

	If a note is played only particular times through a repeat,
	the time-only entity shows which times to play the note.

	The pizzicato attribute is used when just this note is
	sounded pizzicato, vs. the pizzicato element which changes
	overall playback between pizzicato and arco.

	Pitch is represented as a combination of the step of the
	diatonic scale, the chromatic alteration, and the octave.
	The step element uses the English letters A through G.
	The alter element represents chromatic alteration in
	number of semitones (e.g., -1 for flat, 1 for sharp).
	Decimal values like 0.5 (quarter tone sharp) are
	used for microtones. The octave element is represented
	by the numbers 0 to 9, where 4 indicates the octave

	In MusicXML, a cue note is a silent note with no playback.

	the type element. A cue note that is specified as full size
	using the type element will still remain silent.

	The grace element indicates the presence of a grace note. 
	The slash attribute for a grace note is yes for slashed
	eighth notes. The other grace note attributes come from
	MuseData sound suggestions. The steal-time-previous attribute
	indicates the percentage of time to steal from the previous
	note for the grace note. The steal-time-following attribute
	indicates the percentage of time to steal from the following
	note for the grace note, as for appoggiaturas. The make-time
	attribute indicates to make time, not steal time; the units
	are in real-time divisions for the grace note.

	a missing duration indicates the same length as the previous
	note, but the MusicXML format requires a duration for chord
	notes too.

<!--
	The unpitched element indicates musical elements that are
	notated on the staff but lack definite pitch, such as
	unpitched percussion and speaking voice. Like notes, it
	uses step and octave elements to indicate placement on the
	staff, following the current clef. If percussion clef is
	used, the display-step and display-octave elements are
	interpreted as if in treble clef, with a G in octave 4 on
	line 2. If not present, the note is placed on the middle
	line of the staff, generally used for a one-line staff.

	elements. If the measure attribute is set to yes, it
	indicates this is a complete measure rest.

	Duration is a positive number specified in division units.

	in dotted notes in Baroque-era music). Differences in
	duration specific to an interpretation or performance
	should use the note element's attack and release
	attributes.

	The tie element indicates that a tie begins or ends with
	this note. If the tie element applies only particular times
	through a repeat, the time-only attribute indicates which
	times to apply it. The tie element indicates sound; the tied
	element indicates notation.

	The quarter- and three-quarters- accidentals are
	Tartini-style quarter-tone accidentals. The -down and -up
	accidentals are quarter-tone accidentals that include
	arrows pointing down or up. The slash- accidentals
	are used in Turkish classical music. The numbered
	sharp and flat accidentals are superscripted versions
	of the accidental signs, used in Turkish folk music.
	The sori and koron accidentals are microtonal sharp and
	flat accidentals used in Iranian and Persian music. The
	other accidental covers accidentals other than those listed
	here. It is usually used in combination with the smufl
	attribute to specify a particular SMuFL accidental. The
	smufl attribute may be used with any accidental value to
	help specify the appearance of symbols that share the same
	MusicXML semantics. The attribute value is a SMuFL canonical
	glyph name that starts with acc.

	specify an absolute end stem position. Negative values of
	relative-y that would flip a stem instead of shortening

	The notehead element indicates shapes other than the open
	and closed ovals associated with note durations. The element
	value can be slash, triangle, diamond, square, cross, x,
	circle-x, inverted triangle, arrow down, arrow up, circled,
	slashed, back slashed, normal, cluster, circle dot,
	left triangle, rectangle, other, or none. 

	For shape note music, the element values do, re, mi, fa,
	fa up, so, la, and ti are also used, corresponding to Aikin's
	7-shape system. The fa up shape is typically used with upstems;
	the fa shape is typically used with downstems or no stems.

	The arrow shapes differ from triangle and inverted triangle
	by being centered on the stem. Slashed and back slashed
	notes include both the normal notehead and a slash. The
	triangle shape has the tip of the triangle pointing up;
	the inverted triangle shape has the tip of the triangle
	pointing down. The left triangle shape is a right triangle
	with the hypotenuse facing up and to the left.

	The other notehead covers noteheads other than those listed
	here. It is usually used in combination with the smufl
	attribute to specify a particular SMuFL notehead. The
	smufl attribute may be used with any notehead value to
	help specify the appearance of symbols that share the
	sameMusicXML semantics. Its value is a SMuFL canonical
	glyph name that starts with note. Noteheads in the SMuFL
	"Note name noteheads" range (U+E150âU+E1AF) should not use
	the smufl attribute or the "other" value, but instead use
	the notehead-text element.

	For the enclosed shapes, the default is to be hollow for
	half notes and longer, and filled otherwise. The filled
	attribute can be set to change this if needed.

	If the parentheses attribute is set to yes, the notehead
	is parenthesized. It is no by default.

	The notehead-text element indicates text that is displayed
	inside a notehead, as is done in some educational music.
	It is not needed for the numbers used in tablature or jianpu
	notation. The presence of a TAB or jianpu clefs is sufficient
	to indicate that numbers are used. The display-text and
	accidental-text elements allow display of fully formatted
	text and accidentals.

	Beam types include begin, continue, end, forward hook, and

	A tuplet element is present when a tuplet is to be displayed

	to indicate the presence of a bracket. If unspecified, the

	default.

	Whereas a time-modification element shows how the cumulative,

	The tremolo ornament can be used to indicate either

	use the single type, while double-note tremolos use the
	start and stop types. The default is "single" for

	indicates the number of tremolo marks and is an integer
	from 0 to 8. Note that the number of attached beams is
	not included in this value, but is represented separately
	using the beam element.

	When using double-note tremolos, the duration of each note
	in the tremolo should correspond to half of the notated type
	value. A time-modification element should also be added with
	an actual-notes value of 2 and a normal-notes value of 1. If
	used within a tuplet, this 2/1 ratio should be multiplied by
	the existing tuplet ratio.

	Using repeater beams for indicating tremolos is deprecated as
	of MusicXML 3.0.
