<!--
	The common note elements between cue/grace notes and
	regular (full) notes: pitch, chord, and rest information,

<!--
	Notes are the most common type of MusicXML data. The
	MusicXML format distinguishes between elements used for
	sound information and elements used for notation information
	(e.g., tie is used for sound, tied for notation). Thus grace
	notes do not have a duration element. Cue notes have a
	duration element, as do forward elements, but no tie
	elements. Having these two types of information available
	can make interchange easier, as some programs handle one
	type of information more readily than the other.

<!--
	The position and printout entities for printing suggestions
	are defined in the common.mod file.

	The print-leger attribute is used to indicate whether leger
	lines are printed. Notes without leger lines are used to
	indicate indeterminate high and low notes. By default, it
	is set to yes. If print-object is set to no, print-leger
	is interpreted to also be set to no if not present. This
	attribute is ignored for rests.

	The dynamics and end-dynamics attributes correspond to
	MIDI 1.0's Note On and Note Off velocities, respectively.
	They are expressed in terms of percentages of the default
	forte value (90 for MIDI 1.0).

	The attack and release attributes are used to alter the
	starting and stopping time of the note from when it would
	otherwise occur based on the flow of durations - information
	that is specific to a performance. They are expressed in
	terms of divisions, either positive or negative. A note that
	starts a tie should not have a release attribute, and a note
	that stops a tie should not have an attack attribute. The
	attack and release attributes are independent of each other.
	The attack attribute only changes the starting time of a
	note, and the release attribute only changes the stopping
	time of a note.

	If a note is played only particular times through a repeat,
	the time-only entity shows which times to play the note.

	The pizzicato attribute is used when just this note is
	sounded pizzicato, vs. the pizzicato element which changes
	overall playback between pizzicato and arco.

	The step element uses the English letters A through G.
	The alter element represents chromatic alteration in
	number of semitones (e.g., -1 for flat, 1 for sharp).
	Decimal values like 0.5 (quarter tone sharp) are
	used for microtones. The octave element is represented

	grace note. The steal-time-following attribute indicates the
	percentage of time to steal from the following note for the
	grace note, as for appoggiaturas. The make-time attribute
	indicates to make time, not steal time; the units are in

<!--
	The chord element indicates that this note is an additional
	chord tone with the preceding note.

	The duration of a chord note does not move the musical
	position within a measure. That is done by the duration
	of the first preceding note without a chord element. Thus
	the duration of a chord note cannot be longer than the
	preceding note.

	In most cases the duration will be the same as the
	preceding note. However it can be shorter in situations
	such as multiple stops for string instruments.

<!--
	The unpitched element indicates musical elements that are
	notated on the staff but lack definite pitch, such as
	unpitched percussion and speaking voice. Like notes, it
	uses step and octave elements to indicate placement on the
	staff, following the current clef. If percussion clef is
	used, the display-step and display-octave elements are
	interpreted as if in treble clef, with a G in octave 4 on
	line 2. If the child elements are not present, the note is
	placed on the middle line of the staff. This is generally
	used with a one-line staff. Notes in percussion clef should
	always use an unpitched element rather than a pitch element.

	elements are usually empty, but placement on the staff can
	be specified using display-step and display-octave
	elements. If the measure attribute is set to yes, it
	indicates this is a complete measure rest.

	Differences in duration specific to an interpretation or
	performance should be represented using the note element's
	attack and release attributes.

	The duration element moves the musical position when used in
	backup elements, forward elements, and note elements that do
	not contain a chord child element.

	The tie element indicates that a tie begins or ends with
	this note. If the tie element applies only particular times
	through a repeat, the time-only attribute indicates which
	times to apply it. The tie element indicates sound; the tied
	element indicates notation.

	The quarter- and three-quarters- accidentals are
	Tartini-style quarter-tone accidentals. The -down and -up
	accidentals are quarter-tone accidentals that include
	arrows pointing down or up. The slash- accidentals
	are used in Turkish classical music. The numbered
	sharp and flat accidentals are superscripted versions
	of the accidental signs, used in Turkish folk music.
	The sori and koron accidentals are microtonal sharp and
	flat accidentals used in Iranian and Persian music. The
	other accidental covers accidentals other than those listed
	here. It is usually used in combination with the smufl
	attribute to specify a particular SMuFL accidental. The
	smufl attribute may be used with any accidental value to
	help specify the appearance of symbols that share the same
	MusicXML semantics. The attribute value is a SMuFL canonical
	glyph name that starts with acc.

	The notehead element indicates shapes other than the open

	value can be slash, triangle, diamond, square, cross, x,
	circle-x, inverted triangle, arrow down, arrow up, circled,
	slashed, back slashed, normal, cluster, circle dot,
	left triangle, rectangle, other, or none. 

	For shape note music, the element values do, re, mi, fa,
	fa up, so, la, and ti are also used, corresponding to Aikin's
	7-shape system. The fa up shape is typically used with upstems;
	the fa shape is typically used with downstems or no stems.

	The arrow shapes differ from triangle and inverted triangle
	by being centered on the stem. Slashed and back slashed
	notes include both the normal notehead and a slash. The
	triangle shape has the tip of the triangle pointing up;
	the inverted triangle shape has the tip of the triangle
	pointing down. The left triangle shape is a right triangle
	with the hypotenuse facing up and to the left.

	The other notehead covers noteheads other than those listed
	here. It is usually used in combination with the smufl
	attribute to specify a particular SMuFL notehead. The
	smufl attribute may be used with any notehead value to
	help specify the appearance of symbols that share the same
	MusicXML semantics. Its value is a SMuFL canonical glyph
	name. Noteheads in the SMuFL Note name noteheads and
	Note name noteheads supplement ranges (U+E150âU+E1AF and
	U+EEE0âU+EEFF) should not use the smufl attribute or the
	"other" value, but instead use the notehead-text element.

	For the enclosed shapes, the default is to be hollow for
	half notes and longer, and filled otherwise. The filled
	attribute can be set to change this if needed.

	If the parentheses attribute is set to yes, the notehead
	is parenthesized. It is no by default.

	The notehead-text element indicates text that is displayed
	inside a notehead, as is done in some educational music.
	It is not needed for the numbers used in tablature or jianpu
	notation. The presence of a TAB or jianpu clefs is sufficient
	to indicate that numbers are used. The display-text and

	Single-note tremolos use the single type, double-note
	tremolos use the start and stop types, and unmeasured
	tremolos use the unmeasured type. The default is "single"
	for compatibility with Version 1.1. The text of the element
	indicates the number of tremolo marks and is an integer
	from 0 to 8. Note that the number of attached beams is not
	included in this value, but is represented separately using
	the beam element. The value should be 0 for unmeasured
	tremolos.

	When using double-note tremolos, the duration of each note
	in the tremolo should correspond to half of the notated type
	value. A time-modification element should also be added with
	an actual-notes value of 2 and a normal-notes value of 1. If
	used within a tuplet, this 2/1 ratio should be multiplied by
	the existing tuplet ratio.

	Tremolos range for an unmeasured tremolo. It is ignored for

	The bend element is used in guitar notation and tablature.

	alter element, numbers like 0.5 can be used to indicate
	microtones. 
	
	Negative bend-alter values indicate pre-bends or releases.
	The pre-bend and release elements are used to distinguish
	what is intended. A single note with a bend and release
	will contain two bend elements: the first to represent the
	bend and the second to represent the release. The offset
	attribute of the release element specifies where the release
	starts in terms of divisions relative to the current note.
	The first-beat and last-beat attributes of the parent bend
	element are relative to the original note position, not this
	offset value. Because the bend-alter element represents the
	number of steps in the bend, a release after a bend has a
	negative bend-alter value, not a zero value.
	
	The shape attribute distinguishes between the angled bend
	symbols commonly used in standard notation and the curved
	bend symbols commonly used in both tablature and standard
	notation.
	
	A with-bar element indicates that the bend is to be done
	at the bridge with a whammy or vibrato bar. The content
	of the element indicates how this should be notated.
	Content values of "scoop" and "dip" refer to the SMuFL

<!--
	Text underlays for lyrics. The lyric number indicates
	multiple lines, though a name can be used as well. Common
	name examples are verse and chorus. Word extensions are
	represented using the extend element. Hyphenation is
	indicated by the syllabic element, which can be single,
	begin, end, or middle. These represent single-syllable
	words, word-beginning syllables, word-ending syllables,
	and mid-word syllables. Multiple syllables on a single
	note are separated by elision elements. A hyphen in the
	text element should only be used for an actual hyphenated
	word. Two text elements that are not separated by an
	elision element are part of the same syllable, but may have
	different text formatting.

	Humming and laughing elements represent humming and
	laughing voices. The end-line and end-paragraph elements
	come from RP-017 for Standard MIDI File Lyric meta-events;
	they help facilitate lyric display for Karaoke and
	similar applications. Language names for text elements
	come from ISO 639, with optional country subcodes from
	ISO 3166. Justification is center by default; placement is
	below by default. Vertical alignment is to the baseline of
	the text and horizontal alignment matches justification. 
	The print-object attribute can override a note's print-lyric
	attribute in cases where only some lyrics on a note are
	printed, as when lyrics for later verses are printed in a
	block of text rather than with each note. The time-only
	attribute precisely specifies which lyrics are to be sung
	which time through a repeated section.

	The elision element represents an elision between lyric
	syllables. The text content specifies the symbol used to
	display the elision. Common values are a no-break space
	(Unicode 00A0), an underscore (Unicode 005F), or an undertie
	(Unicode 203F). If the text content is empty, the smufl
	attribute is used to specify the symbol to use. Its value
	is a SMuFL canonical glyph name that starts with lyrics.
	The SMuFL attribute is ignored if the elision glyph is
	already specified by the text content. If neither text
	content nor a smufl attribute are present, the elision
	glyph is application-specific.

	The listen and listening elements, new in Version 4.0,
	specify different ways that a score following or machine
	listening application can interact with a performer. The
	listen element handles interactions that are specific to a
	note. When multiple child elements of the same type are

	default assessment to be overridden for individual notes.
	The optional player and time-only attributes restrict the
	element to apply to a single player or set of times through
	a repeated section, respectively. If missing, the element
	applies to all players or all times through the repeated

	Figured bass elements take their position from the first
	regular note (not a grace note or chord note) that follows
	in score order. The optional duration element is used to
	indicate changes of figures under a note.

	Figures are ordered from top to bottom. A figure-number is
	a number. Values for prefix and suffix include plus and
	the accidental values sharp, flat, natural, double-sharp,
	flat-flat, and sharp-sharp. Suffixes include both symbols
	that come after the figure number and those that overstrike
	the figure number. The suffix values slash, back-slash, and
	vertical are used for slashed numbers indicating chromatic
	alteration. The orientation and display of the slash usually
	depends on the figure number. The prefix and suffix elements
	may contain additional values for symbols specific to
	particular figured bass styles. The value of parentheses
	is "no" if not present.
